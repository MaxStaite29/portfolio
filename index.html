     <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Im Max, i am 19 years old and live in the UK.</p>
      <p>I got into code because ive always been around and had an intrest in computers from a young age. 
        Me and my dad would play pc games together when i was younger, 
        so as i got older i wanted to know more about how computers work, therefore sparking my intrest in coding.</p>
